    <div class="intro">
        <p>Berserk follows the journey of Guts, a lone mercenary with a tragic past, who is marked with a cursed brand that attracts demons and other dark forces. Born from the corpse of a dead woman, Guts' life has been filled with violence and loss. He becomes a member of a mercenary group called the Band of the Hawk, led by the charismatic Griffith. Though initially loyal to Griffith, Guts faces inner turmoil as he grapples with his desire for independence and his bond with Griffith, which becomes increasingly strained. The story takes a dark turn when Griffith sacrifices the Band of the Hawk to obtain his dream of ruling the world, marking Guts as his greatest enemy. Betrayed and broken, Guts embarks on a quest for vengeance while struggling with the overwhelming power of the demonic forces hunting him. As he battles through a brutal, war-torn world, Guts becomes entangled in a web of fate, destiny, and the supernatural. Along the way, he meets allies like Casca and Puck, while constantly fighting against the forces of evil and his own inner demons.</p>
